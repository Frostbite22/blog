            <p class="text-gray-500 mb-6">10 August 2020</p>

            <div class="prose max-w-none">
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">Three years ago, I joined a computer science institute in Tunisia
                    called ISAMM. I didn’t know much about Hackathons until the 5 May 2018, my first ever participation
                    at hackathons. It was the most rich experience I have ever had in 24 hours. Specifically, I knew
                    what I didn't know, making contact with experts, tough developers and investors. That competition
                    was an eye-opening event and a real starting point in my career as a computer scientist.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">Unfortunately, I didn’t have the right tools and the right mindset to
                    win my first Hackathon. For these reasons, I dedicate this writing for all those who are starting
                    their career in this field, and those who want to boost their Hackathon experience to get a step
                    ahead and see through opportunities.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">I investigated three of the most influential figures I know in the
                    material of Hackathons. First Elyes Manai, an AI researcher and research & development engineer at
                    Instadeep, Maher Matmati and Ahmed Rebai two software engineers at be-softilys. These guys combine
                    almost 20 Wins at hackathons.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">If you are unfamiliar with the term Hackathon, it is a competition that
                    lasts for 12H, 24H, or 48 hours and longer sometimes, in which each participant team ought to
                    formulate ideas and prototype them to solve a real-life problem, in the frame of a theme proposed
                    by the beneficiary, being start-ups, enterprises, organizations. Hackathon can be business or
                    technical. The first focuses mostly on how to make profits for the beneficiary, while technical
                    hackathons require more developers and technical teams. Winners at Hackathons get prizes in the form
                    of cash, equipment, internships or coupons for courses etc..</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">Hackathons are life hacks for students who want to figure out the best
                    way to learn quickly and extend their network and their domain knowledge. This is true because in
                    24 hours, one should communicate with his teammates, share his knowledge and develop ideas of
                    profitable businesses or cool technologies. And they say, “pressure makes diamonds”.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">Practically speaking, the list of benefits of hackathons is long.
                    Starting with job offers, internships, cash, experience and network. But the key “to hack your
                    hackathon” as Elyes Manai says, are a set of standards that everyone should know and work for that
                    we list below:</p>

                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">1. Key Profiles:</h5>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">As Meher Matmati suggests, each team should have these 3 profiles:
                        The communicator: is the one who communicates the team idea to the jury, having a great aptitude
                        to convince others using different techniques like body language, storytelling and cool visual
                        presentations. The technical: is the one person who can translate the team idea into a working
                        prototype that can amaze the members of the jury and add value to the presentation. The
                        innovator: is a very creative person who can imagine doable ideas “out of the box” and conform
                        with legislation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">2. Team Composition:</h5>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">Each team should be coherent and complementary, says Ahmed Rebai. To
                        boost your chance to win, your team requires a good developer to develop functionalities, a good
                        designer to make your app look attractive and a good spokesman man to sell your prototype and
                        communicate efficiently with others.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">3. Don’t focus on typical functionalities:</h5>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">Instead of building login from scratch, focus on the core
                        functionalities for your idea, which would differentiate you from other participants, like AI,
                        Blockchain, Deep learning or cool new technologies.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">4. Never start coding before fixing the idea:</h5>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">Many teams start coding before fixing the final idea, and then
                        after, they find a better idea and repeat everything from scratch. The idea is more important
                        than the prototype. If the idea is a hit, you go far in that hackathon. Fixing a good idea is
                        the fruit of personal research and communication with the team. Ahmed suggests that every one
                        should get one hour to brainstorm, compare different enterprises and startups and inspire from
                        what was done and then communicate your research to your team.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">5. The perfect triangle:</h5>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">Each winning project should necessarily be in the frame of the
                        perfect triangle, utters Maher. The perfect triangle is the composition of three components:
                        Money: The project must provide a profitable solution. Reality: The project must be feasible.
                        Innovation: The project must be disruptive.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">6. Take good care of your presentation:</h5>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">The presentation is the fruit of 24 hours of your sweat. So make it
                        as attractive and appealing as possible. Never put paragraphs in your presentation,
                        presentation is just a support of what you are going to say or present to the jury. So instead,
                        put videos, images and gifs on it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">7. Confidence:</h5>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">If you’re confident enough, everyone will feel your confidence and
                        start to trust you. If you believe in your idea, you will fight for it until the end.
                        Nevertheless, if you don’t believe in what you do, how can others believe in you?</p>
                </div>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">These are the key takeaways of “how to win a hackathon?”. To sum up,
                    participating in hackathons will extend your vision and craft your skills and will provide more
                    opportunities that you have never thought they exist.</p>
