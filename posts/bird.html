            <p style="font-size: 30px;font-weight: 300;color: #424242;">From a bird's perspective - a Micro-Story</p>
        
            <p style="color: #828282;">16 April 2022</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #333333;">It was almost night, the bird is in its room.
                 He plays the guitar with passion. He sings, he chirps with all his heart. Suddenly, the sky begins to darken.
                  It becomes a deafening storm. Lightning rips through the dark sky. But the bird no longer feels comfortable.
                   He lets out moans of fear. He hears the sound he hates the most. The sound of a hungry cat.
                 He who depends on his parents, not only for food, grains of earth, but also for protection.

            </p>

           <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #333333;">Although he is well educated, well brought up, an artist of good nature,
             he recognizes his great fault: his weakness. He can neither defend himself nor afford a meal.
            The cat's eyes shine in the dark of the room. The bird thinks it's all over for him.
             It's too late to react. But let him leave a message for all the birds of the world:
           </p>

           <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #333333;">“Go out and find your freedom.
            Maybe there won't be any art or food anywhere else. But you will no longer be weak.
            For weakness, dear friends, whatever heights one achieves, only indicates the end.”
       </p>
